DMRG helpers
============

Python modules to process the data generated for our DMRG code.

This stuff was before in the main DMRG repo (under `tools/`), but it was quite
inconvenient to have it there. 

The python code here can be used to analyze and plot the data from DMRG
`estimators.dat` files.
